## JQuery Crystal Collectors Game

## CrystalsCollector Game
  jQuery was used to build a great interactive fun game. The game is centered around four crystals displayed as buttons in the HTML page.  At the start of the game a random number will be displayed to the user. The user will then be required to click one of the buttons, an amount is added to his/her total. 
 The player wins if their total matches the random number, which was identified at the beginning of the game, but loses if their score is greater than the original random score. 
The game will restart when the user wins or loses. 

 Pseudo code was used to develop the initial logic for the game. Once the logic was in place, I determined how HTML and CSS would be used to configure the solution page. I set up variables that were used to load results from jQuery into the Documents Object Model (DOM).
